# Benchmark and Evaluation for Somatic Structural Variants Detection with Long-Read Sequencing Data
## LR-SomSV-BenchMark
## README
Here, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking system for evaluating somatic structural variant (SV) detection strategies using long-read sequencing (LRS) data. It systematically tests 51 different strategies, combining various reference genomes, alignment tools, SV callers, and somatic SV calling methods. The system leverages both real datasets from breast cancer cell lines (HCC1395/HCC1395BL) sequenced with Oxford Nanopore (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), as well as simulated datasets to assess the performance across different sequencing depths, tumor purities, and SV types. Evaluation is based on standard metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score, providing a robust and objective comparison of current tools and strategies for somatic SV detection, ultimately guiding researchers in selecting the most effective methods for their own studies.
